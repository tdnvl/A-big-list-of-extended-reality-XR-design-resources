As I'm getting more involved in XR design, I've run into some great resources (online or not). I thought that sharing them here could be beneficial to others.

## Books on XR design
### The VR Book: Human-Centered Design for Virtual Reality
>The VR Book: Human-Centered Design for Virtual Reality is not just for VR designers, it is for managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user experience professionals.  It is for the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at least the basics of the many aspects of VR design.

### Augmented Reality: Principles and Practice
>This book is a single-source reference, presenting the most significant AR work with scrupulous accuracy. For more than a decade, Dieter Schmalstieg has pioneered both AR theory and application, and now, in this book with Tobias H. HÃ¶llerer, he addresses all aspects of the field, illuminating AR from both technical and HCI perspectives. The authors review AR's technical foundations, including display and tracking technologies; show how AR emerges from the symbiosis of computer vision and computer graphics, introduce AR-specific visualization and 3D interaction techniques, and showcase applications from diverse industries. They conclude by introducing AR smartphone development, including a cutting-edge Qualcomm QCAR case study.
