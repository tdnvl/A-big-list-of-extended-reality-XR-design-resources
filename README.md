>The VR Book: Human-Centered Design for Virtual Reality is not just for VR designers, it is for managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user experience professionals.  It is for the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at least the basics of the many aspects of VR design.
